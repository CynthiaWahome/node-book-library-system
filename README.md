# Book Library Management System

This repository contains a Node.js application for managing a book library. It uses Express.js for the server, CORS for cross-origin requests, and connects to a Replit database. The app supports CRUD operations, including retrieving a list of books via a GET request to the `/api/books` endpoint.

## Features

- **Express.js Server**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
- **CORS**: Enables cross-origin requests.
- **Replit Database**: Stores book data.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete books.

## Endpoints

### Get All Books

- **URL**: `/api/books`
- **Method**: GET
- **Description**: Retrieves a list of all books in the library.
- **Response**: 
  - `200 OK`: Returns an array of books.
